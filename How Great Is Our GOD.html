  <li>The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty </li>
  <li>Let all the earth rejoice </li>
  <li>All the earth rejoice </li>
  <li>He wraps himself in Light, and darkness tries to hide </li>
  <li>And trembles at His voice </li>
  <li>Trembles at His voice</li>

How great is our God, sing with me <br>
How great is our God, and all will see <br>

<p>Age to age He stands <br>
And time is in His hands <br>
Beginning and the end <br>
Beginning and the end<br>
The Godhead Three in One <br>
Father Spirit Son <br>
The Lion and the Lamb <br>
The Lion and the Lamb</p>
<p>Name above all names <br>
Worthy of all praise <br>
My heart will sing </p><br>
<p>How great is our God<br>
How great is our God, sing with me <br></p>
